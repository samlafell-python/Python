# Python

Hey everyone! This is where I'm going to be submitting my Python work to keep track of my progress.

I'm looking to work in Data Consulting for a large Consulting firm. I am attending the Institute for Advanced Analytics as a Masters of Science in Analytics Candidate at NC State University, graduating in May 2020.

Currently: Working on using a Kaggle Dataset to predict what makes songs popular using given metadata.

Any recommendations for projects I should work on relating to Data Visualization and Automating Processes are appreciated!

Also, given a light quantitative background, I'm looking for how to really begin to grasp algorithms and adapating the mindset of a quant professional.
