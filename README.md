# Python

Hey everyone! This is where I'm going to be submitting my Python work to keep track of my progress.

I'm looking to become a Data Analyst or Data Scientist, have not yet decided, and am currently applying to Anaytics graduate programs. I will enroll in 2019 and graduate sometime in 2020.

Currently: Reading "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python". Reading "An Introduction to Statistical Methods and Data Analysis". Watching YouTube to lead me along (Corey Shaffer, Brandon Foltz, Siraj Raval, etc...).

Any recommendations for projects I should work on relating to Data Visualization and Automating Processes are appreciated!

Also, given a light quantitative background, I'm looking for how to really begin to grasp algorithms and adapating the mindset of a quant professional.

Thanks,
Sam
