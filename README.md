# Python

Hey everyone! This is where I'm going to be submitting my Python work to keep track of my progress.

I'm looking to become a Data Analyst or Data Scientist, have not yet decided, and am currently applying to Anaytics graduate programs.

Currently: Pursuing Data Science path on DataCamp. Reading "Introduction to Statistical Learning". Watching YouTube when I'm confused.

Any recommendations for projects I should work on relating to Data Visualization and Automating Processes are appreciated!

Also, any books or resources I should be leveraging!

Thanks,
Sam
